# 🧠 Cryptic Quiz: A Puzzle-Based Web Quiz Application

**Cryptic Quiz** is a fun, challenging **frontend-only web application** built to test a user's logical thinking and decoding abilities. Unlike traditional quizzes, it presents each question as a cryptic puzzle — often involving images, symbols, or riddles — that must be interpreted to progress to the next level.

This project is fully interactive using just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is ideal for showcasing puzzle-based logic and frontend development creativity.
